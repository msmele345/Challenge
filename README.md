* Configuration__
**Clone repo to desktop computer and run the rails server from the app directory. Open Localhost(default port) to view the application.

**This is a PostgreSQL database. Please run rails db:create and rails db:migrate before starting the application. I have also provided a seed file for convienence. Please run rails db:seed to utilize this feature, or feel free to create your own objects and test cases. All objects have views that support creating new instances.
